I recently completed the Classification of Handwritten Digits project as part of my learning experience on the Hyperskill platform. In this project, I used scikit-learn to explore various classification algorithms and developed a model to recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9. I implemented automatic hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the model's performance and built a generalized evaluation approach to assess its accuracy comprehensively.

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of machine learning techniques, model selection, and performance evaluation using scikit-learn.
